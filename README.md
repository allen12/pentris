# pentris
An extension of Alexey Pajitnov's famous game Tetris with pentominos (5-blocked shapes). Created with pygame 1.9.2 and Python 3.5.
Pentris comes with basic functionality, such as having a "hold" slot for unwanted pentominos.

Planned future features:

1. Welcome screen to change starting level
2. Allow multiple replay attempts in the same session to store high score
3. Multiplayer pentris! (if game is not too hard) Clearing lines would "send" garbage lines to the opponent. You win by topping the opponent out!
